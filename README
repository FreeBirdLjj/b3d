Welcome to b3d, written by Issac Trotts (issac.trotts+b3d@gmail.com) 
in consultation with Shawn Mikula in the labs of Edward G. Jones.

To compile b3d, first make sure you have GLUT (the OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
installed.  At the command line, do these steps:

  cd lua-5.0.2
  ./configure
  make
  cd ../jpeg-6b
  ./configure
  make
  cd ..
  make

At this point you should have a working version of b3d.  You can run it like
this:

  src/b3d

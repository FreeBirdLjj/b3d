Welcome to b3d, written by Issac Trotts (issac.trotts+b3d@gmail.com) in consultation with Shawn Mikula in the labs of Edward G. Jones, changed by Junjie LU in 2013.

To compile b3d, first clang and llvm are recommended, and as the default compiler.  Second make sure you have GLUT (the OpenGL Utility Toolkit) and libreadline installed.  At the command line, do these steps:

```sh
	$ make -C projects
```

At this point you should have a working version of b3d.  You can run it like this:

```sh
	$ make run -C projects
```

Or just execute binary file manually:

```sh
	$ bin/b3d
```
